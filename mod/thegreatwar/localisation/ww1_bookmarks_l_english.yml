 # 1910
 POWDERKEG_NAME:0 "The Powderkeg of Europe"
 POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "1910 is a challenging time for the peace in Europe. The Italians are preparing for a war with the Ottomans, which will threaten their hold in the Balkans. Rebellion in Morocco is beginning to boil over, much to the anguish of France and to the delight of the German Empire. All in all, either clear heads will be needed to keep the peace, or strong hearts to win the war."
 FRA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In 1870, France was dealt a blow by the forming German Empire in a crushing war which saw the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. This made an implacable enemy of France, who has been licking her wounds since. Though the territory is German-speaking, the French people simply will not let this humiliation stand.\n\nFortunately, French diplomacy has built an Entente Cordial with the United Kingdom and Russia. When war breaks out, surely the Germans will crumble. The matter is, of course, ''when''."
 USA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "While Europe trudges closer and closer to war and misery, peace and prosperity is the way in the United States in 1910. The success of Dollar Diplomacy and the Roosevelt Corollary have finally secured Latin America from European powers once and for all. The Philippines have been pacified for good.\n\nIt'd be foolish to be blind to Europe, but for now, America is safe to build up."
 ENG_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The British Empire is still at its zenith. Controlling a massive amount of territory in Africa, Asia, and the Americas through both direct rule and dominions, the United Kingdom still has one continent yet to be mastered: Europe. The United Kingdom has a few allies on the mainland, but none they are particularly fond of.\n\nOf course, good king Edward is surely not long for this world, and crown prince George has time to shake things up. What will the next king do for Britannia's place in Europe?"
 GER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "What was once 35 different independent nations is now the German Empire, seen by many as one of the world's foremost powers, if not the strongest of them all. However, there are many who would trifle with such a state. The German enemy of France has formed the Triple Entente of themselves, the UK, and Russia, all far stronger than Germany's own weak allies.\n\nWith just old Austria and disloyal Italy, Germany needs either more friends or more power to survive the coming times."
 ITA_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Italy is  the smallest third of the Triple Alliance, an alliance with which she has little faith in. Austria-Hungary, Italy's natural rival, is now a friend in the world of treaties but still a rival in practical terms. After all, Italian Irredentism still decrees the Austrian-held Dalmatian coast as Italian. For now, however, there are more pressing matters.\n\nWar plans with the Ottoman Turks are already being drawn up. The government predicts a short, decisive war. Italy shall prove her power."
 AUH_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The last century was a curse to the Austrian throne. Humiliation after humiliation was thrust upon her, from the rampage of Napoleon to the unification of Germany by the Prussians. Venerable old Kaiser Franz Josef now stands as the weakest member of the Triple Alliance, with two of her old enemies. But surprisingly, this has gone well for Austria so far.\n\nThe Hapsburgs have inherited Bosnia, and the people of Hungary finally seem placated. Perhaps more good shall come."
 RUS_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Recent years have not been kind to the Russian Empire. With a major military defeat at the hands of Japan, followed by a revolution that forced the once-invincible Tsar into a constitution, the Russian government must get back on its feet and prove its strength again, or risk revolution.\n\nLuckily, the Balkans are turbulent again. The crumbling Ottoman Empire is Russia's opportunity to expand, create new puppet states, and more importantly, prove it is still a world power."
 TUR_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Storm clouds are gathering over Kostantiniyye. Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria have been scheming together again- likely a war to try and claim the territory they unrightfully claim is theirs. The Albanians are close to revolt. The Italian government is also very publicly contemplating a conquest of the Tripoli Vilayet.\n\nLoss of territory is nearly inevitable. Ottoman Diplomacy, therefore, should center around ensuring we keep the capital, if nothing else."
 SER_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Serbia is seen by outsiders as a backwater, minor nation. Nothing more than a pawn in a great game that the world's empires are playing as each other. Of course, the empires of the world may learn sooner than they think that the Serbs are destined for greater things.\n\nCurrently, most Serbs live outside our borders, in Turkish or Austrian territory. If we are to make a deal with the devil- the Bulgarians- the Serbs may begin their road for glory by way of full Serbian unification."
 BUL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Bulgaria has already made a name for itself through successful conflicts against the Serbs and outmaneuvering the Ottoman Empire to unify with Eastern Rumelia. Of course, now the state stands at a more uncomfortable position. The Turks seem unwilling to put up any more Bulgarian territory for grabs, and the Russians are slowly withdrawing their support.\n\nPerhaps it is not too late to mend fences with Serbia? After all, a Bulgaria with strong friends could be a surprising menace."
 MEX_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "The Mexico of 1910 is a strange case indeed. The Porfiriato has been a great boon to Mexico since 1876, but now that the heat has been turned up, it seems President Diaz's time may be limited. Of course, the Government sees this as biting the hand.\n\nFrancisco Madero is actively and obviously plotting against the Diaz government. If he finds himself ambitious enough, he may see Mexico in his own back pocket yet."
 SPR_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Spain is divided, the upper classes, the Catholic Church and the Spanish Army generally favour the Central Powers. The Germanophile tendency is represented among the reactionary Carlists and the conservative Mauristas have closer ties to the Entente because of Spain's 1907 pact with Britain and France. Pro-Allied sentiment, which was generally Francophile, is most common among the middle and professional classes and intellectuals. Nobody yet knows if Spain will choose a side and even less which side..."
 JAP_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "In just under 50 years, Japan has turned from a backwards despotate ruled by a Shogun to a proper modern Empire, just as powerful as any country Europe has to offer. Emperor Meiji is to thank for it, but sadly he is both old and diseased- and can't possibly live much longer.\n\nBefore Crown Prince Yoshihito takes the crown, there are a few more matters to settle, however. The elderly emperor must decide where Japan stands with Russia, and what to do with the Korean vassal."
 BEL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."
 HOL_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Since the Second Hague Conference in 1907, the Netherlands do everything to avoid a Political Alliance with another European Empire.\n\nAs the drums of war resound to the gates of Amsterdam and despite their strong policy of neutrality, the peaceful mill country could soon find itself back to the wall having to make a choice that could forever change the future of the Dutch Empire.\n\nNo one knows how the fiercely patriotic Queen Wilhelmina will react..."
 QIN_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 ""
 SWE_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "At the beginning of the 20th century, Sweden was a country at peace. Indeed, since the Napoleonic Wars and the Treaty of Kiel signed in 1814, the country hasn't experienced any armed conflict and has been able to benefit from a century of peace.\n\nHowever, this fragile peace is threatened by growing tensions between the Great Powers. Will the country remain neutral? Nobody knows..."
 CAN_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Canada has been a loyal subject and friend to the British Crown since it's conception. In such times of turmoil, Canada must look to aiding the Crown and her vast Empire. Although Canada is large with vast resources and rich land, it has a broken economy and a weak army. Canada could stand as the perfect ally in times of great struggle....\n\nBut Canada could find a new purpose, or a new destiny, and be a place for Canadians. This young country is more powerful than it seems!"
 JBS_POWDERKEG_DESC:0 "Jablar Shammar has been for decades in a constant power struggle between the Al-Rashid clan ruling Shammar and the clan of Al-Saud ruling Nejd.\n\nHowever in 1891 Emir Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Rashid was able to get control overt he whole Arabian peninsula after a decisive Battle of Mulayda. Not long after the Saudis reconquered what once belonged to them and only thanks to our ally the Ottoman Empire we were able to survive.\n\nShammar is currently in an uneasy situation aa the Saudis are encroaching from the south and the Ottomans dominating the country."

 # 1914
 SCHLIEFFEN_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The drums of war are beating fervently. In the next year, a war is expected to break out between, at the very least, France and Russia vs. Germany and Austria-Hungary. If more powers end up getting involved, the conflict could be the largest war the world's ever seen. One thing is certain: For many countries, their very existence is on the line."
 FRA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "France's revanche is soon at hand. The return of the Tricolor to Alsace-Lorraine and the rightful French territory owned by the Germans in Africa, seems nearer than ever. Of course, the Germans are just as ready to strike, but France's time to prove a lesson learned is now.\n\nAfter all, surely all that will be needed is the French Élan that was missing from the last war, and the Germans will be sent packing. Of course, there's rumors a long war could be to our disadvantage, but rumors aren't always true, are they?"
 USA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The United States is an isolated, pacifist country, as it has been since Theodore Roosevelt's administration. However, the climate of the world today leaves little room for a nation with America's power to stay out of these affairs. Though Wilson has ran a campaign on isolationism, and seems to have little incentive to change course, the spirit of the Great War could easily force the U.S.A.'s hand.\n\n With Mexico unstable and Europe at each others' throats, how long can the U.S. rise above the fight?"
 ENG_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The situation in Europe has become too much to bear. Germany and France are both far too close to Britain's position for the comfort of the British public. The Kaiser even has the gall to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance. When the war all fear is to come, something simply must be done. Or must it?\n\nThere is the option to let France and Germany grind each other down and build ourselves up. Of course, British troops MUST get involved if Germany- or France, perhaps- end up attacking any British allies..."
 GER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Herr von Bismarck's prediction that the next war will start with a spark from the powder keg of the Balkans seems to be further and further approaching reality. With all of the tension stemming from the region, there's no doubt a war between German and French alliances will break out soon. Germany, therefore, must be prepared.\n\nThe time for diplomacy is over. The German Army must be readied for what could be a long, gruesome, and, worst of all, two-front war."
 ITA_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "22 years ago, Italy halfheartedly joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and the hated Austrians to spite France's gains in Tunisia. Today, the alliance is the most shaky in Europe. With her old alliance, Italy has the chance to get Savoy, Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia for herself. However, the Entente would provide the Dalmatian coast- and seems much more able to do so.\n\nItaly still has time before the war to make a decision. But on which side does her fate lay?"
 AUH_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Austria-Hungary is a resilient state, and has survived much hardship where other states would be destroyed. Yet, the increasing support for Panslavism in Russia combined with the fervor for war in the Balkans poses a threat that may very well spell the end of the Hapsburg rule. Worse yet, the rivalry with the Italians has started again in earnest.\n\nAustria must quell the fury of the Balkan states and stand with Germany against her enemies, or the Empire may become just a cherished memory."
 RUS_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars did little to calm the people of the Russian Empire. Though Russia had thrown their support behind the South Slavic powers, only Serbia and Montenegro are loyal to the empire of the east, and crisis is on the horizon if things don't change- and now. Serbian extremists have proposed trying to break a war out with Austria-Hungary, and this is exactly what Russia needs.\n\nThe clear goals of German Poland and the Slavic lands in Austria are in Russia's sights."
 TUR_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "What was once the world's greatest empire has now fallen to near ruin. The Sultanate is no longer considered a major power in Europe, and the carving of Turkey between all of the European powers is a constant threat that crawls closer and closer to reality. To make matters worse, the incompetent Enver Pasha has seized effective control of the government.\n\nThe best course of action, according to the Porte, is to draw close to Germany, and hope their mighty army can protect us in our time of need."
 SER_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars saw a massive success for Serbia, as well as their most important ally in Greece. The hard part, however has just begun: The Habsburgs still hold the region of Bosnia, as well as other South Slavic territories. Worse yet, they see Serbia as a troublemaker, and would be more than happy to rid the world of the state at a moment's notice.\n\nFortunately, Russia seems to have taken a liking to Serbia, though perhaps for malicious reasons. If Tsar Peter utilizes this, the world may change forever..."
 BUL_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was wrong to trust the Greeks and the Romanians to stay out of the inevitable conflict between themselves and Serbia, and are down to the lowest territorial extent since independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is unlikely they will be fooled twice. Russia seems next in the line of false friends, seeking only to profit from the state.\n\nThe only countries that seem to genuinely have Bulgaria's best interests at heart are Germany and Austria. Perhaps it's time for a new alliance?"
 MEX_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "While initially it seemed Madero's victory in the first phase of the Mexican Civil War was the end of it, in 1913 he was deposed, killed, and replaced by one of his former generals, Victoriano Huerta. Huerta is not popular or terribly competent, and few see him lasting long in command of the nation.\n\nStill, there is no agreement among the Mexican populace as to who is to be the next leader. Some rally behind causes as extreme as Communism or Military Dictatorship. Will Civil War rear its ugly head again?"
 SPR_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Spain is divided, the upper classes, the Catholic Church and the Spanish Army generally favour the Central Powers. The Germanophile tendency is represented among the reactionary Carlists and the conservative Mauristas have closer ties to the Entente because of Spain's 1907 pact with Britain and France. Pro-Allied sentiment, which was generally Francophile, is most common among the middle and professional classes and intellectuals. Nobody yet knows if Spain will choose a side and even less which side..."
 JAP_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Unfortunately, it turns out Emperor Yoshihito is cursed with mental afflictions which have severely impacted his ability to rule. Fortunately, his ministers and other members of the court have begun to administrate Japan in his stead, and the public is getting its first taste of liberty.\n\nStill, what of the war in Europe? Would it be to Japan's benefit to throw in? After all, the British-Japanese alliance is tenuous, and Japan may be better off simply waiting to choose which side will serve its interests."
 BEL_SCHLIEFFEN_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."

 # 1919
 THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_NAME:0 "The Aftermath of Versailles"
 THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The conflict known as the Great War has finally come to an end. The Central Powers have been defeated and carved between Entente members- but world peace is still far from reality. Civil Wars rage in the East, particularly in Russia, while instability plagues in the Near East, in China and in the former Central Powers. Even now, peace and prosperity must be fought for."
 GER_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the German Empire, its shadow, the Weimar Republic, has taken its place in Europe. The new government is plagued by a crippled industry, heavy reparations, and most notably, constant conflicts between Communists and the autocratic Freikorps which threaten to tear the country into civil war.\n\n Few are happy with the status quo. If the Republic does not stabilize itself soon, it may meet the same fate as the Germany of 1848."
 RUS_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "It is the White Russian forces that protect the public from the scourge of Communism. That scourge has proven itself to be a major problem, however. In the last year of conflict, the Soviets have made decisive gains against the disorganized and disunited White movement. There is hope for White Russia yet.\n\nAs long as it can solve the leadership issues and learn to cooperate with international support."
 SOV_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Lenin's movement is burning through the old Russian Empire like a wildfire. The charismatic, driven leader of Soviet Russia is finding friendly peasants nearly everywhere in the East, despite being reviled by the world at large. Still, there is much left to do.\n\n The new and weak states surrounding Russia- especially Poland- must be brought into the fold to create a true World Revolution!"
 POL_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "While the British and French were happy to see a new Polish state on the world stage, few others are pleased with the ''Second Republic''. The defeated Germans desire a return to their old territories, the Czechs and Lithuanians are in a border war, and worst yet- the Soviets are actively attempting to end the state.\n\nWith most of allied Ukraine already lost, Poland is counting on a miracle- but miracles have happened before."
 TUR_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire seems doomed. The country has been reduced to a tiny portion of Anatolia, only a small amount of which the government actually controls. It seems that the state, once the world's foremost empire, is on its deathbed. However, did not Osman overcome greater odds to establish the state to begin with?\n\nCan fate be denied? Can the old guard save the nation in its last moment? Or has the moon truly set once and for all?"
 TUK_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "With the end of the Empire seemingly inevitable, a massive Nationalist movement has emerged, headed up by Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The Hero of Gallipoli has called for a secular, modernist Republic to be established in Anatolia, but his true ambition seems to be the recovery of occupied Turkish-speaking territory.\n\nFew can deny taking on the Europeans as well as the remnants of the empire would be a great challenge. Can the new Turkey overcome it?"
 ITA_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Italy walked away from the Treaty of Versailles still hungry. Despite suffering a massive death toll compared to the population of the nation, only Istria, Zadar, and limited authority over Albania have been awarded to the Kingdom. Though Entente members have already promised a transfer of South Tyrol, this is still little more territory than the Central Powers promised.\n\nIf the public is not satisfied, Italy may turn its anger against its former allies once again."
 FRA_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "In the end, France was just barely able to hold on. The injustice of 1870 has been avenged, German colonies and the Ottoman Levant have bolstered France's empire, and friendly regimes have popped up all over Europe. However, France is still not out of the woods yet.\n\nThe Hapsburg partition is still on the table. Moroccans still protest annexation. Worst of all, the Soviet Union is inspiring the always-present local Communists. If these issues are not dealt with, the victory may be for naught."
 ENG_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Many British sons did not return home from the trenches. Though Tanzania and Namibia have been won, the price paid in blood was steep- especially considering Paris, not London, directs Europe's new governments. In 1919, the British Empire is at its greatest extent- yet it may be the weakest it's ever been.\n\nDiplomacy shall be the new Dreadnought. New agreements and administration shall preserve the empire as our military rebuilds. The first test is dealing with this quabbling in Egypt."
 USA_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The Americans had no appetite for war, and now it's over, it seems more of the public than not is questioning whether it was worth it to intervene. The Federal Government seems to be turning its back on Woodrow Wilson's idealism, towards a cynical neutrality. The Military is already being disarmed, and legislators are fighting every part of the peace process.\n\nIf Congress approves joining the League of Nations, this course may be reversed. If not, the USA may be immersed in unbreakable isolationism."
 JAP_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The Japanese people are, for the first time, living under a democratic government. That idea is not as popular with the public as it may logically seem. The Emperor is clearly not long for this world, and many reactionary figures advocating for a return to autocracy and establishment of colonies have been publicly vocal in the inevitable wake of Prince Hirohito's coronation.\n\nPerhaps they have a point. Perhaps a few campaigns in war-torn China are all Japan needs to become a respected power."
 ###AUS_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Legally speaking, the Austro-Hungarian empire still exists. However, all that is really left is German-Austria, the German-speaking portion of the old domain. The Entente seems to hate the Vienna government most of all, and seeks to impose an incredibly harsh treaty stripping it of even many of those territories, as well as blocking unification with Germany- a diplomatic crisis that must be avoided."
 ###YUG_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (commonly known as Yugoslavia) is a continuation of the Serbian Kraljevina, now a unified south slavic state. Already, it seems the jubilation of liberation is wearing off, with the kingdom's minorities issuing increasingly complaints. The new regional power stands at a cross roads.\n\nShould Yugoslavia expand further? After all, is Bulgaria not rightfully South Slavic? Or, instead, should Yugoslavia turn inwards and stabilize itself?"
 ###HUN_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "The Hungarian government was wrongly treated as a defeated power by the Entente, and already the people have risen up to attempt to avenge themselves. Communist Autocrat Bela Kun has made Hungary his cult of personality, and has, through a series of weak puppet leadership, taken control of Hungary for its revenge campaign.\n\nFirst Romania will fall, then Yugoslavia, then, who knows? Perhaps the world at large!"
 ###ROM_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Romania is perhaps the biggest benefactor from the Great War proportionally, being awarded territory by both the Central Powers and Entente. Though nearly doubling in size and population, it has earned scorn and jealousy throughout Europe. Even at the moment, the hated Hungarians are attempting an invasion.\n\nStill, Romania has ascended to unimagined heights, and once the Magyar are repelled, perhaps may be one of Europe's leading regional powers."
 ###EGY_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Egypt, though supposedly an independent country has in reality little more authority than directly-ruled British colonies in East Africa, a fact most Egyptians are a bit upset about. A revolt has been underway to earn independence, which the British seem willing to grant. Somewhat.\n\nAccepting servitude may provide a stable, independent Egypt. However, prolonging the revolt may grant Sudan...or perhaps even more."

 #~~~CHINA~~~
 #Beiyang or CPM must be able to get Chineese legacy and get major buffs
 ###BEI_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Though Yuan Shikai is dead and gone, his army still rules most of China. Xu Shichang has replaced him, and has some...interesting ideas. Despite being president, he blatantly hates the idea of a republic, regularly abusing power and promoting the return of the Qing Dynasty. The only reason he sits in this position is due to the Cliques.\n\nTruly ruled by warlords, every day the Beiyang Government's authority shrinks further and further. One faction must come out on top soon, or they may all perish.
 #Constitutional Protection Movement
 ###CPM_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Founded by followers of the late Sun Yat-Sen, the Constitutional Protection Movement is an unstable house propped up by a huge coalition of Republicans, Socialists, and even some warlords who just don't like the warlords in Beijing at the moment. Though this has made the regime popular in comparison to the despotic Cliques of the north, one prominent member leaving or changing sides could ruin the Movement's chance to unify China for good.\n\nThis poses the question: How do you please more than 400 million people?"
 
 #~~~GREECE~~~
 #A good Post-War Scenario may needs a Megali Greece
 ###GRE_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Just shy of a century old, Greece has seen little but good news and victory in its time. Its great territorial expansion, most notably a recent return to Anatolia, has come at a cost- the Turkish Republicans are actively attempting to retake their lands. Greece must now, for the first time, truly defend its conquered land.\n\nVictory could potentially mean a return to the City of the World's Desire. Defeat could mean instability and an end to Greek ambitions forever."

 #~~~OTHERS~~~
 OTHER_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "Though The Great War is over, conflicts still rage around the world. Strong leadership may turn even second and third-string world players into superpowers overnight. What opportunities does the chaos of this new world have to offer?"
